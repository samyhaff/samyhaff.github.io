Hi, my name is Samy, I am a PhD student at Télécom Paris working under the supervision of Prof. Fabian M. Suchanek and Prof. Nils Holzenberger.
My research interests lie in the intersection of structured data and language models.
Prior to that, I obtained a MSc in Computer Science from the Technical University of Denmark and a MEng from Centrale Nantes in France.
I created this site because I wanted to share my work, projects and anything else I find interesting with the world.
